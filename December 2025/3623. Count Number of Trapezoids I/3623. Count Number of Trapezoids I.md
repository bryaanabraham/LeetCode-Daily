You are given a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of the ith point on the Cartesian plane.

A horizontal trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of horizontal sides (i.e. parallel to the x-axis). Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

Return the number of unique horizontal trapezoids that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from points.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Solution:
- Since we are only considering horizontal trapezoids we only need to consider the y-axis i.e. the heights of the points.
- creat a dictionary of all the possible heights and irerate over the possible combinations of trapezoids between two heights

```python
class Solution:
    def countTrapezoids(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        heights = defaultdict(int)
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        ans, total_sum = 0, 0

        for point in points:
            heights[point[1]] += 1
        
        for height in heights.values():
            edge = height * (height - 1) // 2
            ans += edge * total_sum
            total_sum += edge

        return ans%mod
```
