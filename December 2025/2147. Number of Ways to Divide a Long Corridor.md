Along a long library corridor, there is a line of seats and decorative plants. You are given a 0-indexed string corridor of length n consisting of letters 'S' and 'P' where each 'S' represents a seat and each 'P' represents a plant.

One room divider has already been installed to the left of index 0, and another to the right of index n - 1. Additional room dividers can be installed. For each position between indices i - 1 and i (1 <= i <= n - 1), at most one divider can be installed.

Divide the corridor into non-overlapping sections, where each section has exactly two seats with any number of plants. There may be multiple ways to perform the division. Two ways are different if there is a position with a room divider installed in the first way but not in the second way.

Return the number of ways to divide the corridor. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7. If there is no way, return 0.

Solution:
- Creat a dfs tree of all possible choices at each stage.
- Perform memoization using a cache to avoid unnecessary recompute
  
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWays(self, corridor: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        cache = [[-1]*3 for _ in range(len(corridor))]

        def dfs(seats, i):
            if i == len(corridor):
                return 1 if seats==2 else 0
            if cache[i][seats] != -1:
                return cache[i][seats]
            if seats == 2:
                if corridor[i] == "S":
                    res = dfs(1, i+1)
                else:
                    res = (dfs(0,i+1) + dfs(2,i+1))%MOD

            else:
                if corridor[i] == "S":
                    res = dfs(seats+1, i+1)
                else:
                    res = dfs(seats, i+1)
            cache[i][seats] = res
            return res
        return dfs(0,0)
```

Solution: Combinatoric
- Create an array or indexes of only the seats
- Get the difference between the indexes of two pairs of seat indexes i.e. subtract the left index of one pair with the right index of the other
- Multiply all these differences to get all the possible outcomes

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWays(self, corridor: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        seats = []
        for i in range(len(corridor)):
            if corridor[i] == "S":
                seats.append(i)

        if len(seats)==2:
            return 1
        if len(seats)%2!=0 or len(seats)<2:
            return 0
        print(seats)
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, len(seats)-1, 2):
            ans *= (seats[i+1] - seats[i])

        return ans%MOD
```
