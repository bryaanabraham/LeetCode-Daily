You are given an integer numberOfUsers representing the total number of users and an array events of size n x 3.

Each events[i] can be either of the following two types:

Message Event: ["MESSAGE", "timestampi", "mentions_stringi"]
This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at timestampi.
The mentions_stringi string can contain one of the following tokens:
id<number>: where <number> is an integer in range [0,numberOfUsers - 1]. There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
ALL: mentions all users.
HERE: mentions all online users.
Offline Event: ["OFFLINE", "timestampi", "idi"]
This event indicates that the user idi had become offline at timestampi for 60 time units. The user will automatically be online again at time timestampi + 60.
Return an array mentions where mentions[i] represents the number of mentions the user with id i has across all MESSAGE events.

All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed before handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.

Note that a user can be mentioned multiple times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted separately.

Solution: Create a dictionary of events grouped by the timestamp and carry out the tasks accordingly (Brute force).

```python
class Solution:
    def countMentions(self, numberOfUsers: int, events: List[List[str]]) -> List[int]:
        events.sort(key=lambda x: int(x[1]))

        mentions = [0] * numberOfUsers
        online = [True] * numberOfUsers
        offline = [0] * numberOfUsers

        sched_events = {}
        for e_type, time, payload in events:
            if time not in sched_events:
                sched_events[time] = []
            sched_events[time].append({"type": e_type, "payload": payload})

        for time in sorted(sched_events.keys(), key=int):
            t = int(time)

            for i in range(numberOfUsers):
                if not online[i] and t >= offline[i]:
                    online[i] = True

            for ev in sched_events[time]:
                if ev["type"] == "OFFLINE":
                    uid = int(ev["payload"])
                    online[uid] = False
                    offline[uid] = t + 60

            for ev in sched_events[time]:
                if ev["type"] == "MESSAGE":
                    tokens = ev["payload"].split()

                    if tokens == ["ALL"]:
                        for i in range(numberOfUsers):
                            mentions[i] += 1

                    elif tokens == ["HERE"]:
                        for i in range(numberOfUsers):
                            if online[i]:
                                mentions[i] += 1

                    else:
                        for key in tokens:
                            uid = int(key[2:])
                            mentions[uid] += 1

        return mentions

```
